## Technical architecture

1. Backend approach:

   - c) No backend initially (client-side only with browser APIs)

2. Image processing:
   - a) Canvas API (client-side, browser-based)


## User flow & features

3. Photo upload:

   - c) Single photo with option to upload different photos later

4. Text splitting parameters:
   - Maximum characters per slide (e.g., 100–125)
   - Minimum slides (e.g., 8)
   - Maximum slides (20 as noted)

5. Export format
   - c) Both options

## MVP scope

6. User accounts:
   - a) No accounts for MVP (anonymous generation)


7. Text customization (MVP):
   - Which options to include: font style (2–3 options), text color, text position (top/center/bottom), background overlay (optional)
   These will work

## Docker setup

8. Docker approach:
   - a) Single container (frontend + backend)

## Suggestions - updated a little

1. Start with client-side processing (Canvas API) to simplify MVP and avoid backend complexity.
2. Aspect ratio: Use 4:5.  1080x1350.
3. Story splitting: split on sentences, but if a sentence exceeds X characters, split on punctuation (periods, commas, semicolons).
4. Default text styling: 2–3 font options (Instagram-style), white/black text with optional shadow for readability.
5. File naming: `carousel_01.jpg`, `carousel_02.jpg`, etc., for easy organization.


Once you answer these, I’ll create a development plan with:
- Tech stack
- Project structure
- Docker setup
- MVP features
- Development workflow
- Deployment path (GitHub → Netlify)
