My brother and I are exploring the idea for developing an app to generate a series of photos, called a carousel by instragram, with text that tell a story with a sentence or part of sentence that will fit on each to photo, most of the time the photos are the same photo. From the examples I have seen there are between 15 to 20 photos. And it looks like they are not the full sentence. There is a 20 photo limit. We believe the photos need to be numbered in order starting with 01, 02, 03, 04 and so on. We would like to be an online app that could be convered into an app in the app stores of google and iOS. help us explore this idea with ideas and suggestions. Please also ask clarifing questions.
